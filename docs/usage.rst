Usage
====================

Pita has to be called from the command line with a fairly simple syntax. A general use example:

::

	$ pita -c config.yaml -i indexdir/

The ``-c`` option defines the location of the configuration file in yaml format. More information of how to make this file can be found
in the subsection (Needs to be added).
The ``-i`` option defines the location of the directory with a genome index generated by `gimmemotifs
<https://github.com/simonvh/gimmemotifs>`_. Using the syntax:

:: 

	$ gimme index [-h] <subcommand> [options] [-i DIR] FASTADIR INDEXNAME
